TwitterClient
=============
This Twitter client runs with the package name "I Can't Believe It's Not Twitter". It is a very simple Twitter client that supports authentication with OAuth, viewing the user's timeline, and posting tweets.

To the example from CodePath, I have added:
   * inline tweet blocking from unwanted timeline sources 
   * image resources
